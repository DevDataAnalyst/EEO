Hi Kevin, am thrilled that we won that huge account,  but could use your help. Juan Vice has been with our company for 14 years and is the most qualified team member to head the account.  However, this is a long-term project and I am wondering if I should promote him as he may be retiring in the next few years.  On the other hand, Ann Wong is almost as qualified as Juan in capabilities and is not eligible for retirement in the near future.  I am concerned about promoting Juan. Can you please help me?  Thanks and Regards,Erin" class="email focus floatLeft" id="mail" src="img/slide_29/slide_29_mail.png" style="display:none;">

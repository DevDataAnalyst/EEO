Hi Kevin,<br><br>

I am thrilled that we won that huge account, but could use your help.Juan Vice has been with our company for 14 years and is the most qualified team member to head the account. However, this is a long-term project and I am wondering if I should promote him as he may be retiring in the next few years. On the other hand, Ann Wong is almost as qualified as Juan in capabilities and is not eligible for retirement in the near future. I am concerned about promoting Juan. Can you please help me?<br><br>

Thanks and Regards,<br>

Potential penalties include the following requirements:<br> 
<ul>
<li>To provide Back Pay<br></li>
<li>To hire applicants who were discriminated against</li>
<li>To promote associates previously denied a promotion</li>
<li>To rehire associates wrongfully terminated</li>
<li>To provide front pay</li>
<li>To provide reasonable accommodation, or other benefits that would make the individual "whole" (in the condition he or she would have been but for the discrimination).</li>
</ul><br>

Some additional consequences for the company may include the following requirements:<br>
<ul>
<li>To pay attorneys' fees</li>
<li>To pay expert witness fees</li>
<li>To pay court costs</li>
</ul><br>

In addition to the items above, a federal contractor who is found guilty of discrimination could be barred from doing business with the US Government, impacting their revenue stream.

            <text><![CDATA[During Kevin's research, he learned about two US government agencies that enforce the laws. He made notes about each agency.<br><br>

Click the post-it notes to read what Kevin has noted down.<br><br>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, often referred to by its acronym EEOC, is the US Federal Agency that enforces the antidiscrimination laws that Kevin just reviewed. The EEOC also investigates discrimination complaints that are filed with them by US workers. This includes complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and coercion on the basis of any protected classification (such as gender or race).<br><br>

Here are some key facts about the EEOC:<br>
<ul>
<li>It is a government agency.</li>
<li>It enforces antidiscrimination laws.</li>
<li>It investigates discrimination complaints filed by US workers.</li>
</ul><br>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, often referred to by its acronym OFCCP, is the US Federal Agency that enforces compliance with the regulations implemented for federal contractors. The OFCCP enforces the regulations through auditing of federal contractors and investigating complaints filed by US applicants and employees.<br><br>

A federal contractor is any company, which sells goods or provides services to the Federal Government. Cognizant is a federal contractor and a large revenue stream comes from the work that is done through Federal Government contracts. Many of these clients are also government contractors.<br><br>

Many government agencies share information on a regular basis. For example, the EEOC during an investigation may find that a government contractor is not complying with the regulations enforced by the OFCCP. The EEOC will continue the charge they are investigating and notify the OFCCP of the organization's non-compliance.<br><br>

Here are some key facts about the OFCCP:<br>
<ul>
<li>It is a government agency.</li>
<li>It enforces antidiscrimination laws for federal contractors.</li>
<li>It audits federal contractors to ensure compliance and investigates discrimination complaints filed by US applicants and employees.</li> 
</ul>

            <text><![CDATA[While conducting his research, Kevin finds public information about two of Cognizant's competitors.<br><br> 

Kevin learns that two of Cognizant's competitors are currently facing litigation for allegations of discrimination towards employees and applicants, who are Caucasian and/or American Nationals. These cases could be certified as class action lawsuits. Many class action lawsuits, if won by the individuals making the claims, result in settlements for millions of dollars.<br><br>  

In addition to the potential financial implications, you should be aware of the potential damage to a company's brand. The US media frequently reports news of discrimination in the US workplace. This type of news coverage can damage a company's reputation with their customers, employees, and job seekers.<br><br>  

Click the buttons to learn more about violation of EEO laws and the potential damages.<br><br> 
Violating US EEO Laws<br>
Companies that face allegations of violating US employment laws can face substantial financial penalties, as well as damage to their reputation and corporate brand. Both Infosys and TATA Consulting Services or TCS are currently in litigation, concerning their employment practices.<br><br>
Allegations Against Infosys & TCS<br>
Some of the allegations raised against Infosys and TCS include:<br>
<ul>

<li>Infosys and TCS discriminated against applicants and employees based on their race (Caucasian and non-South Asians) and their National Origin (American Nationals).</li>
<li>The law suits allege an intentional pattern and practice of discrimination in their employment decisions (hiring, promotions, compensation, and terminations).</li>
<li>Approximately 95% of their workforces in the US are South Asian; however, South Asian representation in the US labor market is approximately 1 to 2%.</li>
<li>Many of their worksites lacked diversity with all of the associates being South Asian.</li>
</ul>
Potential Damages<br>
The plaintiffs are requesting that the cases be classified as class action lawsuits. They are also seeking injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. Both cases received Right To Sue letters from the EEOC. The cases could take years to settle, causing a drain on company resources and impacting profitability.

Hi Erin,<br><br>

I can understand your dilemma. You are wondering whether it'll be wise to choose someone younger, but slightly less qualified to head the account.<br><br>

Cognizant's EEO Policy and the ADEA both prohibit discriminating against an applicant or associate because they are forty years or older. Juan's ability to retire in the near future, which is directly related to his age, should not factor into his eligibility and opportunity for advancement. If Juan is the most qualified you should offer him the role. If he is not interested in heading the account then you can offer it to the next most qualified individual, Ann.<br><br> 

I hope this helps. If you have situations like this in the future, you can also reach out to our Talent Manager for further guidance.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
Kevin

            <text><![CDATA[After Kevin wonders if discrimination is always intentional. He reads on to find out.<br><br>

There are different types of discrimination that may occur in the workplace. As a leader, you should be aware of these potential issues, and should report to Talent Management if you think they may be occurring. It is important to be aware that not only can a company be sued for discrimination and harassment; supervisors can also be sued. Lack of knowledge and intent are not valid excuses for violating the law. If discriminatory or unlawful acts occur, the supervisor is legally liable whether or not the supervisor knew of the event or meant for the situation to occur.

            <text><![CDATA[Adverse Impact discrimination is unintentional, however Disparate Treatment is the deliberate act of treating people differently based on a protected characteristic such as race or gender. Both are unlawful based on the US employment laws that were reviewed earlier.<br><br> 

Click each tab to learn more about Disparate Treatment and Adverse Impact Discrimination.<br><br>

Disparate Treatment is treating an associate differently because of a protected characteristic such as pregnancy, race, or national origin. Let's walk through an example.
Jane was terminated for missing three days of work in one quarter. She claims that male workers who have missed three days of work in a quarter were not terminated. It appears that males and females are being managed differently, and this could be a potential case of disparate treatment. It is key to follow the same process for all associates, apply Cognizant's policies in the same manner, and work with your Talent Manager on issues such as this, in order to ensure that all associates are being managed against the same set of standards.<br><br>
Adverse Impact Discrimination is when an employment practice negatively impacts one group more significantly than another group. Let's walk through an example.
The BU is hiring, and the role or project being filled does not require relocation. However, to be considered for employment, an individual must be able to relocate when the current project ends in three to five years. Requiring relocation for a future project or role, could knock women out of the hiring process at a much higher rate than men. This could result in adverse impact against women as a group.

Click each tab to learn more about the Equal Pay Act and Title VII.<br><br>

Through the Equal Pay Act or EPA the US government has taken a more aggressive stance on investigating potential pay discrimination. Recent regulatory changes based on the EPA have been designed to provide federal agencies with greater visibility into federal contractor pay practices, including a requirement to submit aggregated compensation data to the EEOC annually. <br><br>

The EPA stipulates that no employer can discriminate between employees on the basis of sex (gender) by paying wages to employees, at a rate less than the rate at which they pay wages to employees of the opposite sex, for equal work on the jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and are performed under similar working conditions.<br><br>

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) is significantly broader in scope than the EPA, making it unlawful to discriminate against employees and job applicants in any of our employment practices, which includes compensation based on sex, race, color, religion, or national origin. The Government is paying close attention to pay practices. It will now have access to employers aggregate compensation data on an annual basis. Cognizant ensures that its compensation decisions are driven by factors that are objective, non-discriminatory, and defensible.

            <text><![CDATA[Compensation should NOT be driven by subjective, discriminatory factors. Research shows that in the US, women and minorities are typically paid less for the same work. We do not want to perpetuate pay discrimination that originated at another employer by basing starting pay on what an individual was previously earning. Starting pay should be determined by the role an individual is hired for and by objective and valid compensation drivers.<br><br>

Compensation changes must have a strong business case driven by objective, quantifiable standards, and must be well documented as they may need to be defended during a government investigation or audit.<br>
Click the buttons to learn more about compensation drivers.<br><br>
Some valid compensation drivers are:<br>
<ul>

<li>Experience</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Certification</li>
<li>Company tenure </li>
<li>Time in grade level</li>
<li>Performance </li>
<li>Skill Set</li>
<li>Objective, quantifiable standards</li><br>
</ul>
Some invalid compensation drivers are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>National Origin</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Any other legally protected group</li>
<li>Favoritism </li>
<li>Subjective, immeasurable factors</li>

The VEVRAA prohibits discrimination against US military veterans in all employment practices, including compensation and sets regulatory requirements for federal contractors. Our obligations under VEVRAA as a federal contractor will be discussed in the next module.

Kevin also learned from his TM that paying Michael differently from Major Clegg would NOT violate the EPA or VEVRAA since the pay differences are NOT being driven by discriminatory factors such as gender (EPA) or military status (VEVRAA). 
<br><br>A strong business case is needed anytime an associate's pay is being modified; this includes modifications to base pay, bonus pay, and revision pay. If discrimination is found in its pay practices, Cognizant could be required to provide back pay, front pay, and sign a conciliation agreement with the US Government. Loss of government work and damage to our corporate brand are also potential consequences.

            <text><![CDATA[Kevin has had a challenging day at work and has been tested on his decision-making skills. Through the situations presented, Kevin has learned that he is responsible for ensuring that our associates are treated fairly and US employment laws are followed. Let's do a high level review of what Kevin learned today:<br>
<ol>
<li>Cognizant's EEO policy statement is very clear that Cognizant and the Executive Leadership are committed to ensuring that applicants and associates are not discriminated against in any of its employment practices based on their age, sex, color, race, creed, national origin, religion, marital status, citizenship status, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, affection preference, disability status, protected veteran status, membership, or activity in local human rights commission, status with regard to public assistance, or any other classification protected by applicable law.</li>

<li>There are numerous antidiscrimination laws in the US that protect workers. Leaders need to be familiar with these laws and ensure compliance. Some potential remedies imposed by the Federal Government for discrimination in the workplace include payment for back pay or front pay, requirement to hire, promote, reinstate, provide reasonable accommodation, or other actions that would make an individual "whole".<br><br>Click the Continue button to read on.</li><br>

<li>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, often referred to by its acronym EEOC, is the US Federal Agency that enforces the civil rights and antidiscrimination laws that were reviewed.</li>

<li>Adverse impact is unintentional, whereas a disparate treatment is the deliberate act of treating people differently based on a protected characteristic such as race or gender. Both are unlawful based on the laws that we reviewed earlier in the module.</li>

<li>Through the Equal Pay Act or EPA, the Federal Government has taken a more aggressive stance on investigating potential pay discrimination. Compensation decisions should be based on objective and quantifiable standards.</li>
</ol>
